ISSUES FIXED - 2025-08-15
========================

1. PAGE NAVIGATION ERRORS
   Issue: "Page element not found: overview-page" errors when clicking tabs
   Cause: Timing issues with DOM initialization and multiple switchTab wrappers
   Fix: 
   - Made switchTab globally available immediately
   - Added DOM readiness checks before initialization
   - Added error checking in switchTab to verify page exists

2. DUPLICATE CARD LOADING
   Issue: CardEnhancerV2 was duplicating card loading already done by main.html
   Cause: Both main.html and CardEnhancerV2 were trying to manage cards
   Fix:
   - Removed duplicate card loading from CardEnhancerV2
   - Removed unnecessary switchTab wrapping in CardEnhancerV2
   - main.html now exclusively handles card loading via CardRegistry

3. ALL SCREENS SHOWING SAME CONTENT
   Issue: Every page displayed identical cards
   Cause: Hard-coded getCardsForPage function wasn't using CardRegistry
   Fix:
   - Integrated CardRegistry.getCardsForPage() into main.html
   - Added proper card size mapping for different card types
   - Each page now shows its registered cards correctly

4. CARD SIZE MAPPING
   Issue: Cards weren't displaying with correct sizes
   Cause: Missing size mapping from card definitions to grid dimensions
   Fix:
   - Added switch statement to map card sizes (wide, tall, compact, etc.)
   - Cards now render with appropriate grid dimensions

5. COMPONENT INITIALIZATION
   Issue: Utils component was expected but FMUtils was loaded
   Cause: Name mismatch in QA test expectations
   Fix: Updated test to look for FMUtils instead of Utils

CURRENT STATE:
- All 7 pages have unique card combinations
- 15 unique card types distributed across pages
- No duplicate page layouts
- CardRegistry properly filters cards by page
- Navigation works without errors
